# Convert String to Camel Case

It converts the words into camel case which is the practice of writing phrases without spaces or punctuation and with capitalised words.

## Description

It detects dash or underscore and eliminates it and combines all the words capitalising the first letter. 

The first word within the output should be capitalised only if the original word was capitalised(Upper Camel Case or Pascal case). 

The next words should be always capitalised.
